inputs:
  mist_uri:
    description: >
      The Mist.io URI. Points to the Mist.io service that will handle the
      workflows' execution. You should NOT this input, unless you are running
      your own Mist.io installation. Defaults to the Mist.io SaaS.
    type: string
    default: 'https://mist.io'
  mist_token:
    description: >
      An API Token generated by Mist.io in order to be used with every request
      to authenticate to the Mist.io API. Either a username/password combo or
      a Mist.io Token has to be specified. In the former case, the username &
      password will be used in order to auto-generate an API Token to be used
      in subsequent API calls.
    type: string
  mist_machine:
    description: >
      The spec of the machine to be provisioned. This input must comply with:
      `cloudify.datatypes.mist.MachineParams`. To use an existing machine the
      `cloud_id` and `machine_id` are required. The `machine_id` indicates the
      use of an existing resource. If the `machine_id` is left blank, then the
      rest of the inputs have to be provided according to each cloud provider's
      spec and required parameters. Note that `cloud_id` is always required.
  mist_tags:
    description: >
      A dictionary of tags to be applied to the VM after provisioning it. This
      input may also be used to propagate a Mist.io Template's tags to the VMs
      of the Stack created. If a Template has been tagged in Mist.io, then the
      tags will be automatically merged into the existing mist_tags dictionary.
